In 2015, I founded a business from scratch and successfully scaled it within a year. Following that, I transitioned to working as a graphic designer for four years before discovering my true calling in community building. Throughout my career, I have successfully crafted vibrant communities for diverse organizations, each with their own unique vision and purpose as part of the&nbsp;<a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" href=\"https://akashagrawal.xyz/project/community-folks\"><strong>Community Folks</strong></a>&nbsp;team. I have been hosting online and offline <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" href=\"https://akashagrawal.xyz/project/events\"><strong>events</strong></a>, including global events with <strong><a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" href=\"/project/events\">Commsor</a></strong>.</p><p>I'm also a founding team member of a travel startup called \"<a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" href=\"https://akashagrawal.xyz/project/travander\"><strong>Travander</strong></a>.\" As part of the team, I helped develop a clear business model, design a go-to-market strategy, identify the right demographic, create a community strategy, and launch it with internal members.</p><p>But the truth is, community building has been a part of me all along. Even before I knew the formal terminology for it, I was creating successful gaming communities on Discord and expanding them over time by delegating responsibilities to other passionate users.</p><p>My ultimate goal is to bring together like-minded individuals and foster a strong sense of community, while also delivering significant business value.</p><p>I approach community building with a deep understanding of its transformative potential for businesses. I recognize that a thriving community is more than just a collection of individualsâ€”it is a catalyst for growth, customer loyalty, and brand advocacy. By prioritizing authentic engagement, fostering inclusivity, and cultivating a sense of belonging, I consistently deliver tangible results for the organizations I serve.</p><p>Helping others and bringing people together is what truly motivates me, and <strong>I'm always just a ping away!</strong> Oh, and did I mention that I'm also a huge animal lover with a soft spot for creatures big and small, whether they reside on land, in the mountains, or in the sea and sky?</p><p>According to me,</p><blockquote><p>Community Builders are the Unsung Superheroes who donâ€™t wear capes.</p></blockquote>"}],"slug":"about","ext":".html","tags":[],"excerpt":"","date":"2023-07-25 11:44:31 +0530","content":"","url":"/about/","relative_path":"_pages/about.html","permalink":null},{"draft":false,"categories":[],"layout":"default","permalink":"/","title":"Home","content_blocks":[{"_bookshop_name":"hero","title":"Hi there, I am Akash Agrawal","description_html":"<p>A <strong>Community Builder</strong> by passion and profession with a proven track record for success and certified by <a href=\"/project/thecommunityclub\"><strong>The Community Club</strong></a>.
