      <p>&nbsp;</p><p>Hi! I love building communities and contributing in them,
      do you also?</p><p>A little about me: After building a business from
      scratch in 2015 and scaling it to success within a year, working as a
      freelance graphic designer for almost 4 years, I discovered the world of
      community building.</p><p>Although I had been building communities long
      before that, without knowing the formal terminology for it. On Discord, I
      started gaming communities and effectively expanded them over time,
      handing the reins off to other engaged users.</p><p>Helping people and
      bringing them together is what motivates me.</p><p>I am a big time animal
      lover, from smallest to largest, from land to mountains and from sea to
      sky, I love them all.</p><p>I believe Community Builders are the
      superheroes without cape.</p><p>And I am always just a ping
      away!</p><p>According to me,</p><blockquote><p><strong>Community Builders
      are the Unsung Superheroes who don’t wear
      capes.</strong>​​​​​​</p></blockquote>
